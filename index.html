      <h2>My Skills.</h2>
        <em><p class="">Listed below are a few skills that I have....
        Well I'm an Engineer or rather on my way to become one, and I am very analytical and logical
        Despite that i used to sketch alot
        I used to also play the keyboard, like i played it for a year or so
        This may seem a bit suprising but i also used to dance, and was pretty well at it according to my Mentor and peers...
        Then I was in my school's team for a variety of sports like : footbal, basketball, table-tennis.</em></p>

          <em><p>I am learning how to create websites, web-apps and much more,
          As being a Computer-Science student I obviously find
          these things to be intresting, there is no better feeling than being
          much more better and useful than your competition......</em></p>

        <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
        <p><em>I am also learning Marketing
        Because what good is having a skill
        Or being good at something
        If no one is even aware of it?
        Hence Marketing is essential to make my target audience aware that I exist</em></p>
